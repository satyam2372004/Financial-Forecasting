# 📊 Financial Forecasting with ARIMA, SARIMAX & Prophet

This project demonstrates **time series forecasting** of financial data (Revenue & Expenses) using statistical and machine learning models.  
The goal is to analyze historical financial trends, check stationarity, decompose the series, and forecast future values.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization  
- Seasonal decomposition of financial data  
- Stationarity check using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test  
- Forecasting with:
  - **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)  
  - **SARIMAX** (Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous factors)  
  - **Prophet** (by Meta/Facebook)  
- Model evaluation with RMSE  
- 12-month future predictions  
- Clean plots for Revenue & Expenses trends
