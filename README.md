# 📊 Financial Forecasting with ARIMA, SARIMAX & Prophet

This project demonstrates **time series forecasting** of financial data (Revenue & Expenses) using statistical and machine learning models.  
The goal is to analyze historical financial trends, check stationarity, decompose the series, and forecast future values.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization  
- Seasonal decomposition of financial data  
- Stationarity check using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test  
- Forecasting with:
  - **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)  
  - **SARIMAX** (Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous factors)  
  - **Prophet** (by Meta/Facebook)  
- Model evaluation with RMSE  
- 12-month future predictions  
- Clean plots for Revenue & Expenses trends

## ⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-forecasting.git
cd financial-forecasting
Create a virtual environment & install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
(If you’re running on Kaggle or Google Colab, most libraries are pre-installed.
You may need to install pmdarima manually:)


pip install pmdarima
📘 Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook step by step:


jupyter notebook notebooks/forecasting.ipynb
Or run the Python script:


python main.py
📊 Example Output
Revenue & Expense trends

Decomposition plots (Trend, Seasonal, Residuals)

ARIMA, SARIMAX & Prophet predictions

12-month financial forecast

(You can add screenshots of your plots here for better presentation!)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Statsmodels

pmdarima

Prophet (Meta)

## 📈 Results
ARIMA and SARIMAX capture seasonality and trend well

Prophet provides interpretable forecasts with components (trend/seasonality/holidays)

Best model selection is based on RMSE
